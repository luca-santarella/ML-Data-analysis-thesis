# ML-Data-analysis-thesis
Jupyter notebooks, code, data and thesis made for my Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
The thesis aims to conduct a data analysis regarding cryptocurrency exchanges using statistical
tests often used in financial data such as Benford’s Law, trade size clustering on round
numbers and analysis of the correlation relationship between trading volume and transaction
data. 
We also propose a machine learning approach to detect anomalies in trading volumes
with convolutional autoencoders using unsupervised learning, as well as an attempt to normalize
the trading volumes reported using web traffic data of the exchanges’ websites. 
The techniques employed can be used as good indicators of potentially fraudulent activities such
as wash trading and volume inflation which benefit dishonest cryptocurrency exchanges at
the expense of regulated cryptocurrency exchanges which follow mandatory regulatory compliance
and by creating a false perception of the cryptocurrency market for customers.
